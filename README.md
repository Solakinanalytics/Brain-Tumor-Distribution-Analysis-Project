# Brain-Tumor-Distribution-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes brain tumor patient data to identify patterns in tumor distribution, affected age groups, tumor sizes, and diagnosis trends over time. The analysis compares confirmed and unconfirmed cases to support data-driven healthcare insights.

## Problem Statement
Brain tumor occurrence varies across age groups, tumor types, brain regions, and diagnosis status. Without structured analysis, it is difficult to identify high-risk groups and dominant tumor patterns. This project aims to address that gap through exploratory analysis and visualization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains anonymized patient-level information, including:
- Patient age
- Tumor grade and type
- Tumor size
- Affected brain region
- Diagnosis status (confirmed and unconfirmed)
- Year of diagnosis

## Methodology
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset
- Handled missing and inconsistent values
- Performed exploratory data analysis on tumor distribution and demographics
- Built data models and calculated measures
- Designed interactive dashboards for insight presentation

## Key Insights
- The 41–50 age group records the highest tumor occurrence.
- Glioma and Meningioma are among the most common tumor types.
- The pituitary and brainstem regions are frequently affected.
- Confirmed cases show smaller average tumor sizes compared to unconfirmed cases.
- Diagnosis trends fluctuate across years, indicating changes in detection or reporting.
